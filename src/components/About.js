      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Front and back-end capable web developer with a background in the music
        industry from production to performance as well as the service industry.
        Received full-stack web development certificate from Georgia Institute
        of Technology in 2023. Through the projects developed in this program, I
        have cultivated a skill set that includes a familiarity with HTML, CSS,
        Javascript, MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Between this
        program and prior professional experience, I've also developed and
        expanded on the ability to work and be productive in high stress
        environments while communicating effectively with a team.
